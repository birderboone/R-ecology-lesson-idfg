## Creating objects in R

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Creating objects in R
```

You can get output from R simply by typing math in the console:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
3 + 5
12 / 7
```

However, to do useful and interesting things, we need to assign *values* to
*objects*. To create an object, we need to give it a name followed by the
assignment operator `<-`, and the value we want to give it:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 55
```

`<-` is the assignment operator we will use in this course. It assigns values on the right to objects on
the left. So, after executing `x <- 3`, the value of `x` is `3`.   For historical reasons, you can also use `=`
for assignments, but not in every context. Because of the
[slight](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2008/12/use-equals-or-arrow-for-assignment.html)
[differences](https://renkun.me/2014/01/28/difference-between-assignment-operators-in-r/)
in syntax, it is good practice to always use `<-` for assignments.

<!--
<notes> </notes>
-->

**\<note>** Use this time to explain and show that <- actually means to assign something a value. This is easy not to understand for a beginner
**\</note>**  

In RStudio, typing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>\-</kbd> (push <kbd>Alt</kbd> at the
same time as the <kbd>\-</kbd> key) will write `<-` in a single keystroke in a PC, while typing <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>\-</kbd> (push <kbd>Option</kbd> at the
same time as the <kbd>\-</kbd> key) does the same in a Mac.

Objects can be given almost any name such as `x`, `current_temperature`, or `subject_id`. Here are some further guidelines on naming objects:

- You want your object names to be explicit and not too long.
- They cannot start with a number (`2x` is not valid, but `x2` is).
- R is case sensitive, so for example, `weight_kg` is different from `Weight_kg`.
- There are some names that cannot be used because they are the names of fundamental functions in R (e.g., `if`, `else`, `for`, see
  [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html)
  for a complete list). In general, even if it's allowed, it's best to not use
  other function names (e.g., `c`, `T`, `mean`, `data`, `df`, `weights`). If in
  doubt, check the help to see if the name is already in use.
- It's best to avoid dots (`.`) within names. Many function names in R itself have them and dots also have a special meaning (methods) in R and other programming languages. To avoid confusion, don't include dots in names.
- It is recommended to use nouns for object names and verbs for function names.
- Be consistent in the styling of your code, such as where you put spaces, how you name objects, etc. Styles can include "lower\_snake", "UPPER\_SNAKE", "lowerCamelCase", "UpperCamelCase", etc. Using a consistent coding style makes your code clearer to read for your future self and your collaborators. In R, three popular style guides come from [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml), [Jean
  Fan](https://jef.works/R-style-guide/) and the
  [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/). The tidyverse style is very comprehensive and may seem overwhelming at first. You can install the [**`lintr`**](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) package to automatically check for issues in the styling of your code.

### Objects vs. variables

**\<note>** This is a good lesson to cement in that the script and the console are related to each other
**\</note>**  

What are known as `objects` in `R` are known as `variables` in many other
programming languages. Depending on the context, `object` and `variable` can
have drastically different meanings. However, in this lesson, the two words
are used synonymously. For more information see:
[https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Objects](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Objects)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can force R to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the object name:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 55    # doesn't print anything
weight_kg          # just typing the object name will print it to the console
print(weight_kg)   # does the same thing

```

Now that R has `weight_kg` in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. For
instance, we may want to convert this weight into pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):

```{r, purl=FALSE}
2.2 * weight_kg
```

We can also change an object's value by assigning it a new one:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 57.5
2.2 * weight_kg
```

This means that assigning a value to one object does not change the values of
other objects. For example, let's store the animal's weight in pounds in a new
object, `weight_lb`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg
```

and then change `weight_kg` to 100.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 100
```

What do you think is the current content of the object `weight_lb`? 126.5 or 220?

### Saving your code

Up to now, your code has been in the console. This is useful for quick queries
but not so helpful if you want to revisit your work for any reason.
You can open a script under the <kbd>File</kbd> tab.  
It is wise to save your script file immediately. To do this press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>. This will open a dialogue box where you
can decide where to save your script file, and what to name it.
The `.R` file extension is added automatically and ensures your file
will open with RStudio.

Don't forget to save your work periodically by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>S</kbd>.

### Comments

The comment character in R is `#`.  Anything to the right of a `#` in a script
will be ignored by R. It is useful to leave notes and explanations in your
scripts.
For convenience, RStudio provides a keyboard shortcut to comment or uncomment a paragraph: after selecting the
lines you  want to comment, press at the same time on your keyboard
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>. If you only want to comment
out one line, you can put the cursor at any location of that line (i.e. no need
to select the whole line), then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> +
<kbd>C</kbd>.

What are the values after each statement in the following?

```{r, purl=FALSE}
mass <- 47.5            # mass?
age  <- 122             # age?
mass <- mass * 2.0      # mass?
age  <- age - 20        # age?
mass_index <- mass/age  # mass_index?
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}

```

### Functions and their arguments

Functions are "canned scripts" that automate more complicated sets of commands
including operations assignments, etc. Many functions are predefined, or can be
made available by importing R *packages* (more on that later). A function
usually takes one or more inputs called *arguments*. Functions often (but not
always) return a *value*. A typical example would be the function `sqrt()`. The
input (the argument) must be a number, and the return value (in fact, the
output) is the square root of that number. Executing a function ('running it')
is called *calling* the function. An example of a function call is:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- sqrt(10)
```

Here, the value of 10 is given to the `sqrt()` function, the `sqrt()` function
calculates the square root, and returns the value which is then assigned to
the object `weight_kg`. This function takes one argument, other functions might take several.

The return 'value' of a function need not be numerical (like that of `sqrt()`),
and it also does not need to be a single item: it can be a set of things, or
even a dataset. We'll see that when we read data files into R.

Arguments can be anything, not only numbers or filenames, but also other
objects. Exactly what each argument means differs per function, and must be
looked up in the documentation (see below). Some functions take arguments which
may either be specified by the user, or, if left out, take on a *default* value:
these are called *options*. Options are typically used to alter the way the
function operates, such as whether it ignores 'bad values', or what symbol to
use in a plot.  However, if you want something specific, you can specify a value
of your choice which will be used instead of the default.

### How to make a PB&J sandwich with R

Now an important fact here is that functions are just a bunch of code wrapped together.
Its just a canned recipe with set requirements/ingredients and always makes the same thing.
Its like saying, I want to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. But I want to
make it the exact same every single time. How would you instruct someone how to make
a peanut butter jelly sandwich and guarantee they'll make it the same every time?

Well you can write a recipe for them or an entire 'PB&J cookbook'. In R we have this same options. We can either
share scripts or make them functions/packages.

So lets start with writing a recipe. How would you write a recipe for a PB&J that you could share with someone.  
It would probably look something like this:

```
Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich
Ingredients
- 2 slices of sandwich bread
- Jelly
- Peanut butter

Instructions
- Lay out two slices of bread
- Spread 2tbsp of peanut butter on one slice of bread
- Spread 2tbsp of grapy jelly on the other slice of bread
- Place the two pieces of bread together
- Cut diagonal with a knife
- Serve!
```

I can hand you this recipe and you'll know how to make a PB&J sandwich reliably. 
This is your script. The script itself does not do the work. The script is just the recipe you hand over. The console is **you**, **you** are the one making the recipe.

We'll play with this concept as we go.

Now whats a function? Well its basically a PB&J cookbook. Its a package of recipes. The R console can use those recipes, take the ingredients you give it, and pop out a metaphorical sandwich.  It makes the same sandwich every single time.

Lets look at the standard deviation function

```{r,results="show"}
sd
```

**\<note>** Heres where we can explain that a function without the parenthesis works differently than with parenthesis **\</note>**


When you print out a function without giving the parenthesis it will show you the **script** or the **recipe** it uses. This is one of the most simple functions. If you ignore the 'is.___' and you know that sqrt is the square root function and var is the variance function. Then it takes an input and calculates the square root of the variance.

Let's try a simple function that can take multiple arguments: `round()`.

```{r,results="hide"}
round
?round
```

It has two arguments, x and digits. These are the ingredients to your round function. `x` is a common variable term for the data, in order to calculate the standard deviation it obviously needs **the data**. 

It also is telling us it needs something else, digits. I know from the return and from the help file, that this argument is telling us how many digits to round our number to. This digits argument is set equal to 0. What does that mean? When you're running a function, the = means you're assigning a value to that argument. This is how we tell the function what ingredient we want to use. Maybe you want to give it wheat bread, not white bread, maybe grape jelly not strawberry. etc.

In our theoretical PB&J function this is what our arguments would be:

```
pbj(bread = "white bread", jelly="smuckers grape jelly", peanut_butter = "jif smooth peanut butter")
```

So what the round function is trying to tell us with digits=0 is it's telling us the default answer its going to use if you dont give it one. If we don't tell it what kind of peanut butter or jelly we want to use, it will use the default: JIF smooth peanut butter and Smuckers grape jelly.

We can rewrite our PB&J recipe to match this concept like this:
```
Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich
Ingredients
- 2 slices of sandwich bread
- Jelly (Smuckers Grape Jelly)
- Peanut butter (JIF Smooth Peanut Butter)

Instructions
- Lay out two slices of bread
- Spread 2tbsp of peanut butter on one slice of bread
- Spread 2tbsp of grapy jelly on the other slice of bread
- Place the two pieces of bread together (peanut butter to jelly)
- Cut diagonal with a knife
- Serve!
```

And in our round function, its telling us if we don't assign a value to `digits` its going to use its default '0' meaning round to 0 decimals.



```{r, results="show", purl=FALSE}
round(3.14159)
```

Here, we've called `round()` with just one argument, `3.14159`, and it has
returned the value `3`. If we want more digits we can see how to do that by getting
information about the `round` function.  We can use `args(round)` to find what
arguments it takes, or look at the
help for this function using `?round`.

```{r, results="show", purl=FALSE}
args(round)
```

We see that if we want a different number of digits, we can
type `digits = 2` or however many we want.

```{r, results="show", purl=FALSE}
round(3.14159, digits = 2)
```

If you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined you
don't have to name them:

```{r, results="show", purl=FALSE}
round(3.14159, 2)
```

And if you do name the arguments, you can switch their order:

```{r, results="show", purl=FALSE}
round(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)
```

It's good practice to put the non-optional arguments (like the number you're
rounding) first in your function call, and to then specify the names of all optional
arguments.  If you don't, someone reading your code might have to look up the
definition of a function with unfamiliar arguments to understand what you're
doing.

**\<note>** I've heard the rule of thumb to name your arguments if its more than 3 **\</note>**


## Vectors and data types

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Vectors and data types
```

A vector is the most common and basic data type in R, and is pretty much
the workhorse of R. A vector is composed of a series of values, which can be
either numbers or characters. We can assign a series of values to a vector using
the `c()` function. For example we can create a vector of animal weights and assign
it to a new object `weight_g`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
weight_g
```

A vector can also contain characters:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog")
animals
```

The quotes around "mouse", "rat", etc. are essential here. Without the quotes R
will assume objects have been created called `mouse`, `rat` and `dog`. As these objects
don't exist in R's memory, there will be an error message.


#### Characters, string, and quotation marks  

**\<note>** 
We usually lose some people here. Its good to pause here and go over what a character is and how R understands quotations.
**\</note>**

#### data types
In all programming languages you have to specify the kinds of data you're using. 

In R, all R objects are built mainly from 4 **data types or atomic vector** :  
- `"numeric"`  
- `"character"`   
- `"logical"` for `TRUE` and `FALSE` (the boolean data type)  
- `"integer"` for integer numbers. Essentially a numeric with no decimal.  

Why is this important? Why do you have to tell R (or any programming language) what your data is. Well it has to know what you want it to do. And you dont want it to guess. 
Programming languages largely dont like to guess, and they shouldnt. 
If they do guess it should be well documented what and why. 
The easiest and safest way to write languages is to have standards and conventions.
This usually means the annoying task of having to define what kind of data something is. 
But having these data types is a way of making
sure that R runs smoothly and reliably every time.

##### This easiest example is '1' as written on a scientific data sheet. 

'1' can be all 4 data types

- 1 is a number. Its the first number!. It can also have a certain accuracy.  
- 1 is also an integer. Its a non-decimal exact number. Its 1!.  
- 1 is also used in logical. Well known in programming, but less known outside.  

A common way to write or understand true and false is also 1 and 0. 
It either is or isnt. Off or on. The absolute foundation of programming and electronics itself!  

- 1 can also be a character. "1" its not the first its not the measured value of 1.  
It is simply maybe your first plot. Number 1 because maybe an arbitrary reason. It was the first plot you went to.  

Now if youre trying to make a recipe and you gave it a value of 1, you can argue that
the first three examples are sort of the same and shouldn't matter. 
Whether it was a numeric, integer, or logical representation of 1, 
you should always calculate the standard deviation, square root, mean, 
the same. A logical value might mean youre doing something wrong.
As that doesnt make **that much sense**.  

But what if 1 really meant 'Plot 1', in that case taking the mean of 'Plot 1' 
well...isn't very logical. You'd want R to probably stop and warn you something is weird. And thats actually what R does! Another reason to have these data standards.

<!-- Could maybe put a CHALLENGE here -->
So moving back to understanding objects..

#### Objects

There are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a
vector or an object. 
`length()` tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:

```{r,purl=FALSE}
length(weight_g)
length(animals)
```

Inspecting objects and their properties can help troubleshooting problems or how to use new functions.

For example. An important feature of a vector, is that all of the elements are the same type of data.  
The function `class()` indicates what kind of object you are working with:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
class(weight_g)
class(animals)
```

The function `str()` provides an overview of the structure of an object and its
elements. It is a useful function when working with large and complex
objects:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
str(weight_g)
str(animals)
```

You can use the `c()` function to add other elements to your vector:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_g <- c(weight_g, 90) # add to the end of the vector
weight_g <- c(30, weight_g) # add to the beginning of the vector
weight_g

```

In the first line, we take the original vector `weight_g`,
add the value `90` to the end of it, and save the result back into
`weight_g`. Then we add the value `30` to the beginning, again saving the result
back into `weight_g`.

We can do this over and over again to grow a vector, or assemble a dataset.
As we program, this may be useful to add results that we are collecting or
calculating.

An **atomic vector** is the simplest R **data type** and is a linear vector of a single type.

You can check the type of your vector using the `typeof()` function and inputting your vector as the argument.

```{r}
typeof(weight_g)
```

Vectors are one of the many **data structures** that R uses. Other important
ones are lists (`list`), matrices (`matrix`), data frames (`data.frame`),
factors (`factor`) and arrays (`array`).

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

### Challenge
<!-- rewrite this challenge to test how to subset vectors and use the %in% function then ask the bonus challege -->

- We've seen that atomic vectors can be of type character,
  numeric (or double), integer, and logical. But what happens if we try to mix these types in
  a single vector?

::::::: solution

R implicitly converts them to all be the same type

::::::::::::::::

- What will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use `class()`
  to check the data type of your objects):
  
  ```r
  num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
  num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
  char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
  tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
  ```

- Why do you think it happens?

::::::: solution

Vectors can be of only one data type. R tries to
convert (coerce) the content of this vector to find a "common
denominator" that doesn't lose any information.

::::::::::::::::

- How many values in `combined_logical` are `"TRUE"` (as a character) in the
  following example (reusing the 2 `..._logical`s from above):
  
  ```r
  combined_logical <- c(num_logical, char_logical)
  ```

::::::: solution

Only one. There is no memory of past data types, and the coercion happens the
first time the vector is evaluated. Therefore, the `TRUE` in `num_logical`
gets converted into a `1` before it gets converted into `"1"` in
`combined_logical`.

::::::::::::::::

- You've probably noticed that objects of different types get
  converted into a single, shared type within a vector. In R, we
  call converting objects from one class into another class
  *coercion*. These conversions happen according to a hierarchy,
  whereby some types get preferentially coerced into other
  types. Can you draw a diagram that represents the hierarchy of how
  these data types are coerced?

::::::: solution

logical → numeric → character ← logical

::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
## We've seen that atomic vectors can be of type character, numeric, integer, and
## logical. But what happens if we try to mix these types in a single

## What will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use `class()` to

num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")

num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)

char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)

tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")

## Why do you think it happens?

## _coercion_. These conversions happen according to a hierarchy,
## whereby some types get preferentially coerced into other types. Can
## you draw a diagram that represents the hierarchy of how these data
## types are coerced?
```

## Subsetting vectors

If we want to extract one or several values from a vector, we must provide one
or several indices in square brackets. For instance:

```{r, results="show", purl=FALSE}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[2]
animals[c(3, 2)]
```

We can also repeat the indices to create an object with more elements than the
original one:

```{r, results="show", purl=FALSE}
more_animals <- animals[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]
more_animals
```

R indices start at 1. Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB, Julia, and R start
counting at 1, because that's what human beings typically do. Languages in the C
family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0 because that's
simpler for computers to do.

### Conditional subsetting

Another common way of subsetting is by using a logical vector. `TRUE` will
select the element with the same index, while `FALSE` will not:

```{r, results="show", purl=FALSE}
weight_g <- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)
weight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]
```

Typically, these logical vectors are not typed by hand, but are the output of
other functions or logical tests. For instance, if you wanted to select only the
values above 50:

```{r, results="show", purl=FALSE}
weight_g > 50    # will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet the condition
## so we can use this to select only the values above 50
weight_g[weight_g > 50]
```

You can combine multiple tests using `&` (both conditions are true, AND) or `|`
(at least one of the conditions is true, OR):

```{r, results="show", purl=FALSE}
weight_g[weight_g > 30 & weight_g < 50]
weight_g[weight_g <= 30 | weight_g == 55]
weight_g[weight_g >= 30 & weight_g == 21]
```

Here, `>` for "greater than", `<` stands for "less than", `<=` for "less than
or equal to", and `==` for "equal to". The double equal sign `==` is a test for
numerical equality between the left and right hand sides, and should not be
confused with the single `=` sign, which performs variable assignment (similar
to `<-`).

A common task is to search for certain strings in a vector.  One could use the
"or" operator `|` to test for equality to multiple values, but this can quickly
become tedious. The function `%in%` allows you to test if any of the elements of
a search vector are found:

```{r, results="show", purl=FALSE}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat", "cat")

# return both rat and cat
animals[animals == "cat" | animals == "rat"]

# return a logical vector that is TRUE for the elements within animals
# that are found in the character vector and FALSE for those that are not
animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat", "bird", "fish")

# use the logical vector created by %in% to return elements from animals
# that are found in the character vector
animals[animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat", "bird", "fish")]
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

<!--  we need another challenge here. Do an actual challenge and then at the
end have an option challenge -->

### Challenge (optional){.challenge}

- Can you figure out why `"four" > "five"` returns `TRUE`?

::::::: solution

When using ">" or "\<" on strings, R compares their alphabetical order.
Here "four" comes after "five", and therefore is "greater than" it.

::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Challenge (optional)
##
## * Can you figure out why `"four" > "five"` returns `TRUE`?
```

## Missing data

As R was designed to analyze datasets, it includes the concept of missing data
(which is uncommon in other programming languages). Missing data are represented
in vectors as `NA`.

When doing operations on numbers, most functions will return `NA` if the data
you are working with include missing values. This feature
makes it harder to overlook the cases where you are dealing with missing data.
You can add the argument `na.rm = TRUE` to calculate the result as if the missing
values were removed (`rm` stands for ReMoved) first.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights)
max(heights)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

If your data include missing values, you may want to become familiar with the
functions `is.na()`, `na.omit()`, and `complete.cases()`. See below for
examples.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
## Extract those elements which are not missing values.
heights[!is.na(heights)]

## Returns the object with incomplete cases removed.
#The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or #`"double"`).
na.omit(heights)

## Extract those elements which are complete cases.
#The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or #`"double"`).
heights[complete.cases(heights)]
```

Recall that you can use the `typeof()` function to find the type of your atomic vector.

### Challenge

1. Using this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector, `heights_no_na`, with the NAs removed.
  
  ```r
  heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)
  ```

2. Use the function `median()` to calculate the median of the `heights` vector.

3. Use R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.

:::::::: solution

```{r, answer=TRUE}
heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)

# 1.
heights_no_na <- heights[!is.na(heights)]
# or
heights_no_na <- na.omit(heights)
# or
heights_no_na <- heights[complete.cases(heights)]

# 2.
median(heights, na.rm = TRUE)

# 3.
heights_above_67 <- heights_no_na[heights_no_na > 67]
length(heights_above_67)
```

Now that we have learned how to write scripts, and the basics of R's data
structures, we are ready to start working with the Portal dataset we have been
using in the other lessons, and learn about data frames.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- `<-` is used to assign values on the right to objects on the left
- Code should be saved within the Source pane in RStudio to help you return to your code later.  
- '#' can be used to add comments to your code. 
- Functions can automate more complicated sets of commands, and require arguments as inputs.
- Vectors are composed by a series of values and can take many forms. 
- Data structures in R include 'vector', 'list', 'matrix', 'data.frame', 'factor', and 'array'.
- Vectors can be subset by indexing or through logical vectors.
- Many functions exist to remove missing data from data structures.

Before we begin the next chapter I want everyone to make sure they've created a `data` folder in their working directory.

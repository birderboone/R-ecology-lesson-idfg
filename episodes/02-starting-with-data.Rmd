### Loading the survey data
```

We are investigating the animal species diversity and weights found
within plots at our study site. The dataset is stored as a comma
separated value (CSV) file. Each row holds information for a single
animal, and the columns represent:

| Column          | Description                                  |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| record_id       | Unique id for the observation                |
| month           | month of observation                         |
| day             | day of observation                           |
| year            | year of observation                          |
| plot_id         | ID of a particular experimental plot of land |
| species_id      | 2-letter code                                |
| sex             | sex of animal ("M", "F")                     |
| hindfoot_length | length of the hindfoot in mm                 |
| weight          | weight of the animal in grams                |
| genus           | genus of animal                              |
| species         | species of animal                            |
| taxon           | e.g. Rodent, Reptile, Bird, Rabbit           |
| plot_type       | type of plot                                 |

### Downloading the data

We created the folder that will store the downloaded data (`data`)
in the chapter ["Before we
start"](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/00-before-we-start.html#Organizing_your_working_directory).
If you skipped that part, it may be a good idea to have a look now, to
make sure your working directory is set up properly.

We are going to use the R function `download.file()` to download the CSV
file that contains the survey data from Figshare, and we will use
`read.csv()` to load the content of the CSV file into R.

Inside the `download.file` command, the first entry is a character
string with the source URL
("<https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169>"). This source URL
downloads a CSV file from figshare. The text after the comma
("data/portal_data_joined.csv") is the destination of the file on
your local machine. You'll need to have a folder on your machine called
"data" where you'll download the file. So this command downloads a
file from Figshare, names it "portal_data_joined.csv" and adds it to a
preexisting folder named "data_raw".

**\<note>** check here that everyone has this file **\</note>**

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

### Reading the data into R

The file has now been downloaded to the destination you specified, but R
has not yet loaded the data from the file into memory. To do this, we
can use the `read.csv()` function.


```{r, eval=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
str(surveys)
```

When you execute `read.csv` on a data file, it looks through the first
1000 rows of each column and guesses its data type. For example, in this
dataset, `read.csv()` reads `weight` as `integer` (a numeric data
type), and `species` as `character`. You have the option to specify
the data type for a column manually by using the `colClasses` argument in
`read.csv`. 

<!-- not sure this is what it does in read.csv -->

::: callout
### Note

`read.csv()` assumes that fields are delineated by commas. However, in
several countries, the comma is used as a decimal separator and the
semicolon (;) is used as a field delineator. If you want to read in this
type of files in R, you can use the `read.csv2()` function. It behaves
like `read.csv()` but uses different parameters for the decimal and the
field separators. There is also the `read.delim()` for tab separated data
files. Check out the help for
`read.table()` by typing `?read.table` to learn more.


**\<note>** You can just skip this in class, but leave it in notes for others to read later **\</note>**  

In addition to the above versions of the csv format, you should develop
the habits of looking at and recording some parameters of your csv
files. For instance, the character encoding, control characters used for
line ending, date format (if the date is not split into three
variables), and the presence of unexpected
[newlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) are important
characteristics of your data files. Those parameters will ease up the
import step of your data in R.
:::

We can see the contents of the first few lines of the data by typing its
name: `surveys`. By default, this will show you as many rows and columns
of the data as fit on your screen. If you wanted the first 50 rows, you
could type `print(surveys, n = 50)`

We can also extract the first few lines of this data using the function
`head()`:

```{r, results="show", purl=FALSE}
head(surveys)
```

Unlike the `print()` function, `head()` returns the extracted data. You
could use it to assign the first 100 rows of `surveys` to an object
using `surveys_sample <- head(surveys, 100)`. This can be useful if you
want to try out complex computations on a subset of your data before you
apply them to the whole data set. There is a similar function that lets
you extract the last few lines of the data set. It is called (you might
have guessed it) `tail()`.

To open the dataset in RStudio's Data Viewer, use the `view()` function, or just click the spreadsheet symbol in the Environment pane:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
view(surveys)
```


## What are data frames?

When we loaded the data into R, it got stored as an object of class
`data frame` Data frames are the *de facto*
data structure for most tabular data, and what we use for statistics and
plotting. Data frames can be created by hand, but most commonly they are
generated by functions like `read.csv()`; in other words, when importing
spreadsheets from your hard drive or the web.

A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table
where the columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because
columns are vectors, each column must contain a single type of data
(e.g., characters, integers, factors). For example, here is a figure
depicting a data frame comprising a numeric, a character, and a logical
vector.

![](./fig/data-frame.svg)

We can see this also when inspecting the <b>str</b>ucture of a data
frame with the function `str()`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
str(surveys)
```

This info can also be seen by looking in the environment frame of RStudio and clicking on the arrow button. You can also open and View the data.frame by clicking on the spreadsheet icon.


## Inspecting data frames

We already saw how the functions `head()` and `str()` can be useful to
check the content and the structure of a data frame. Here is a
non-exhaustive list of functions to get a sense of the content/structure
of the data. Let's try them out!

-   Size:

    -   `dim(surveys)` - returns a vector with the number of rows in the
        first element, and the number of columns as the second element
        (the **dim**ensions of the object)
    -   `nrow(surveys)` - returns the number of rows
    -   `ncol(surveys)` - returns the number of columns

-   Content:

    -   `head(surveys)` - shows the first 6 rows
    -   `tail(surveys)` - shows the last 6 rows

-   Names:

    -   `names(surveys)` - returns the column names (synonym of
        `colnames()` for `data.frame` objects)
    -   `rownames(surveys)` - returns the row names

-   Summary:

    -   `str(surveys)` - structure of the object and information about
        the class, length and content of each column
    -   `summary(surveys)` - summary statistics for each column

Note: most of these functions are "generic", they can be used on other
types of objects besides `data.frame`.

## Indexing and subsetting data frames

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}

## Indexing and subsetting data frames
```

Our survey data frame has rows and columns (it has 2 dimensions), if we
want to extract some specific data from it, we need to specify the
"coordinates" we want from it. Row numbers come first, followed by
column numbers. However, note that different ways of specifying these
coordinates lead to results with different classes.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
# We can extract specific values by specifying row and column indices
# in the format: 
# data_frame[row_index, column_index]
# For instance, to extract the first row and column from surveys:
surveys[1, 1]

# First row, sixth column:
surveys[1, 6]   

# We can also use shortcuts to select a number of rows or columns at once
# To select all columns, leave the column index blank
# For instance, to select all columns for the first row:
surveys[1, ]

# The same shortcut works for rows --
# To select the first column across all rows:
surveys[, 1]

# An even shorter way to select first column across all rows:
surveys[1] # No comma! 

# To select multiple rows or columns, use vectors!
# To select the first three rows of the 5th and 6th column
surveys[c(1, 2, 3), c(5, 6)] 

# We can use the : operator to create those vectors for us:
surveys[1:3, 5:6] 

# This is equivalent to head_surveys <- head(surveys)
head_surveys <- surveys[1:6, ]

# As we've seen, when working with tibbles 
# subsetting with single square brackets ("[]") always returns a data frame.
# If you want a vector, use double square brackets ("[[]]")

# For instance, to get the first column as a vector:
surveys[[1]]

# To get the first value in our data frame:
surveys[[1, 1]]
```

`:` is a special function that creates numeric vectors of integers in
increasing or decreasing order, test `1:10` and `10:1` for instance.

You can also exclude certain indices of a data frame using the "`-`"
sign:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys[, -1]                 # The whole data frame, except the first column
surveys[-(7:nrow(surveys)), ] # Equivalent to head(surveys)
```

Data frames can be subset by calling indices (as shown previously), but
also by calling their column names directly:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# As before, using single brackets returns a data frame:
surveys["species_id"]
surveys[, "species_id"]

# Double brackets returns a vector:
surveys[["species_id"]]

# We can also use the $ operator with column names instead of double brackets
# This returns a vector:
surveys$species_id
```

In RStudio, you can use the autocompletion feature to get the full and
correct names of the columns.

## Factors

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Factors
```

When we did `str(surveys)` we saw that several of the columns consist of
integers. The columns `genus`, `species`, `sex`, `plot_type`, ...
however, are of the class `character`. Arguably, these columns contain
categorical data, that is, they can only take on a limited number of
values.

R has a special class for working with categorical data, called
`factor`. Factors are very useful and actually contribute to making R
particularly well suited to working with data. So we are going to spend
a little time introducing them.

A factor is essentially a character, but with two extra properties.  
- They have predefined values  
- These values have levels.  
- They have some order to them, whether its meaningful or not

As we'll see this type of data is a mix of programming and scientific necessity. 
They dont sole exist for programming reasons and theyre not insignificant from a scientific/statistical standpoint.

ex.

So say you have Treatment 1, Treatment 2, and Treatment 3 in a study and measured results in each treatment.  
Maybe herbicides on three different range plots.  
Through a scientific lens these are distinctly different categories and should be treated separately.

There are not 4 different kinds of treatments only 3. You can not analyze treatment 4 it does not exist.  
So that satisfies criteria one and two.

Do they have an order to them?

Well maybe. If you were to graph these using a bar graph what order would you want to see the treatments displayed in?

Treatment 2, Treatment 3, Treatment 1?  
Or  
Treatment 1, Treatment 2, Treatment 3?  

Obviously 1->2->3 is aesthetically pleasing.  

From a statistical stand point is this scientifically meaningful?  
No, if i ran an anova across these, it wouldnt matter which was first.  
But if I'm graphing it I want a way to tell the program which comes first.  

Now in some analysis lets say you had 1 plot and 3 treatments and you applied each treatment
one at a time and measured some value after each treatment.  
Or going back to our PB&J recipe and each ingredient is a treatment. 
The measured variable is deliciousness of the sandwich.  

Is the order meaningful in those examples? Yes.

The 'Treatment' variable here is a factor. It has predetermined levels, and optionally it has an order to those levels. Whether statistically meaningful or just aesthetically meaningful.

Factors are special and only really exist in statistical programming languages. 
You wont see them elsewhere because theyre built from a mix of statistical and programming necessity.

So lets return to what is a factor in R...

Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values,
known as *levels*. Factors are stored as integers associated with labels
and they can be ordered or unordered. While factors look (and often
behave) like character vectors, they are actually treated as integer
vectors by R. So you need to be very careful when treating them as
strings.

When importing a data frame with `read.csv()`, the columns that contain
text are not automatically coerced (=converted) into the `factor` data
type, but once we have loaded the data we can do the conversion using
the `factor()` function:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys$sex <- factor(surveys$sex)
```

We can see that the conversion has worked by using the `summary()`
function again. This produces a table with the counts for each factor
level:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
summary(surveys$sex)
```

By default, R always sorts levels in alphabetical order. For instance,
if you have a factor with 2 levels:

```{r, purl=TRUE}
sex <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male"))
```

R will assign `1` to the level `"female"` and `2` to the level `"male"`
(because `f` comes before `m`, even though the first element in this
vector is `"male"`). You can see this by using the function `levels()`
and you can find the number of levels using `nlevels()`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
levels(sex)
nlevels(sex)
```

Sometimes, the order of the factors does not matter, other times you
might want to specify the order because it is meaningful (e.g., "low",
"medium", "high"), it improves your visualization, or it is required by
a particular type of analysis. Here, one way to reorder our levels in
the `sex` vector would be:

```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
sex # current order
sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("male", "female"))
sex # after re-ordering
```

In R's memory, these factors are represented by integers (1, 2, 3), but
are more informative than integers because factors are self describing:
`"female"`, `"male"` is more descriptive than `1`, `2`. Which one is
"male"? You wouldn't be able to tell just from the integer data.
Factors, on the other hand, have this information built in. It is
particularly helpful when there are many levels (like the species names
in our example dataset).

###
###      * How many rabbits were observed?
###      * How many different genera are in the `genus` column?

```

### Converting factors

If you need to convert a factor to a character vector, you use
`as.character(x)`.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
as.character(sex)
```

In some cases, you may have to convert factors where the levels appear
as numbers (such as concentration levels or years) to a numeric vector.
For instance, in one part of your analysis the years might need to be
encoded as factors (e.g., comparing average weights across years) but in
another part of your analysis they may need to be stored as numeric
values (e.g., doing math operations on the years). This conversion from
factor to numeric is a little trickier. The `as.numeric()` function
returns the index values of the factor, not its levels, so it will
result in an entirely new (and unwanted in this case) set of numbers.
One method to avoid this is to convert factors to characters, and then
to numbers.

Another method is to use the `levels()` function. Compare:

```{r, purl=TRUE}
year_fct <- factor(c(1990, 1983, 1977, 1998, 1990))
as.numeric(year_fct)               # Wrong! And there is no warning...
as.numeric(as.character(year_fct)) # Works...
as.numeric(levels(year_fct))[year_fct]    # The recommended way.
```

Notice that in the `levels()` approach, three important steps occur:

-   We obtain all the factor levels using `levels(year_fct)`
-   We convert these levels to numeric values using
    `as.numeric(levels(year_fct))`
-   We then access these numeric values using the underlying integers of
    the vector `year_fct` inside the square brackets

<!-- Still deciding if the above is necessary or not -->

:::

The automatic conversion of data type is sometimes a blessing, sometimes
an annoyance. Be aware that it exists, learn the rules, and double check
that data you import in R are of the correct type within your data
frame. If not, use it to your advantage to detect mistakes that might
have been introduced during data entry (for instance, a letter in a
column that should only contain numbers).
